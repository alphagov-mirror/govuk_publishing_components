body: |
  This component is based on the [design system accordion component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/)
  and is currently experimental because more research is needed to validate it.  If using this component, [please feed back any research findings to the Design System team](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/#next-steps).

accessibility_criteria: |
  The accordion must:

    * accept focus
    * be usable with a keyboard
    * the controls must change in appearance when keyboard focus moves to it
    * the controls must indicate when the mouse is hovered over it
    * be usable with touch
    * be usable with voice commands
    * have visible text
    * indicate to users that each section can be expanded and collapsed
    * inform the user when a step has been expanded or collapsed
    * be readable when only the [text of the page is zoomed in](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/font-size-and-zoom-increase-size-of-web-pages#w_how-to-only-change-the-size-of-the-text)
    * zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
    * pass colour contrast
    * the accordion header button element has aria-controls set to the ID of the element containing the accordion panel content.
    * section content must have aria-label / aria-labelledby with a value that refers to the button that controls display of the content.

  Section headings must use a button element:

    * so that sections can be toggled with the space and enter keys

  When JavaScript is unavailable the component must:

  * be fully expanded
  * not be marked as expandable

  with_supplied_identification:
    description: |
      An `id` is optional as it's automatically generated, but it can be supplied if a specific `id` is required.

      The `id` must be **unique** across the domain of your service - this is because as the open / closed state of individual instances of the accordion persists across page loads using `localStorage`.

      Used as an `id` in the HTML for the accordion as a whole, and also as a prefix for the `id`s of the section contents and the buttons that open them, so that those `id`s can be the target of `aria-labelledby` and `aria-control` attributes.

  with_data_attributes:

      Adds custom data attributes to the accordion to each section. Accepts an hash, so multiple attributes can be added.

      The `data_attributes` hash is for the outermost element in the accordion.

      Each item can also have a `data_attributes` hash. This is placed on the `button` that triggers the opening and closing - useful for differentiating between each section of the accordion.
