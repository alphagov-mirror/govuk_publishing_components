body: |
  This component is build to be used with a focusable elements that refers to it.

  The contextual guidance must have an id. The input must refer the contextual guidance using a `data-contextual-guidance`
  attribute (e.g. `<input data-contextual-guidance="my-contextual-guidance-id">`).

  On tablet and desktop, the guidance container is set to float on the page and prevent other elements from moving around (e.g. pushing next fields down the page).

  To use this component in a form built using a grid layout, an `gem-c-contextual-guidance__form` class needs to be added to the wrapping `<form>` element.
  When used like this the last guidance won't overflow in order to prevent it from overlapping with the footer.
