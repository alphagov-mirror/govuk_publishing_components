name: Image card
description: Image and associated text with a link
body: |
  An image and links, meant for use for news articles and people. Includes optional paragraph and additional links.

  The component is generally to be used within a grid column but has no grid of its own, so the text and the images in the examples below may not always line up. This will normally look tidier, for example [on pages like this](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/attorney-generals-office).
accessibility_criteria: |
  The component must:

  - include alt text for images when present
  - not have duplicate links for the image and the text
shared_accessibility_criteria:
  - link

      The only required parameter to the component is href but if no heading_text is supplied the link will not appear. This is to allow the component to use only extra links as shown.

      In this situation the link could have been applied to the image but having a link on the image like this without text can be confusing.
