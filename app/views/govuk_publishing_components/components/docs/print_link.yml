name: Print link
description: A link with a print icon to help users print the current page
body: |
  This component renders two different outputs depending on whether a `href` is specified. By default, when no `href` is given, the component renders as a button and triggers a print action via JavaScript. In this case the component is hidden in environments where JavaScript is disabled and can be used as a progressive enhancement. When a `href` is specified the component renders as an anchor tag and navigates to that `href` without JavaScript, suitable for applications which have paths that trigger a print event on load.

  - The print icon must be presentational and ignored by screen readers.

examples:
  default:
    description: This component calls `print()` via the browser's DOM API. By default it relies on JavaScript and is not shown in environments where JavaScript is disabled. The \"link\" here is actually a button tag because this is not a navigation event. 
  with_different_text:
    data:
      text: "Print this manual"
  with_different_href:
    description: You can specify a alternative `href` URL that will override the default behaviour. When a `href` is specified the print link will render as an anchor tag and be displayed even when JavaScript is disabled.
